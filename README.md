# Electricity Demand Prediction

## Overview
The Electricity Demand Prediction project analyzes and forecasts electricity consumption based on historical demand and weather data. The aim is to enhance demand forecasting for efficient energy management.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Integration**: Loads and integrates data from multiple sources while ensuring consistency.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers; converts data types and engineers relevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and patterns in electricity demand over time, providing insights into relationships between features.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and manages outliers using IQR and Z-score methods.
- **Regression Modeling**: Builds and evaluates a regression model to predict electricity demand, assessing performance with key metrics.
